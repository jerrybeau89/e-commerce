## Usage
Navigate to the integrated terminal associated with the server.js file. 

 Then you must source the schema.sql, as well as seed the file. Ensure your MySQL server is started. 

    You can run the following commands:

  `mysql.server start`

  `mysql -u root -p`

    Enter your password, then enter:

  `source db/schema.sql`

    Then to exit MySQL:

  `quit;`

    Then, enter:

  `npm i`

  `npm seed`

  `npm start`

    And the application will start!

From there you will transition to Insomnia and use the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes available to interact with the database. You will be able to create new, update, or delete categories, products, and tags. You will have to set up a .env file. an example is located in the repo.
